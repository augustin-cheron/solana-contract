Router is not supper important for now

We need and extractor type for Serde / borsh / anchor IDL (use borsh)


Use BPF type format to export / matching function ?
https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html

Build a javascript BTF reader
Embed BTF in a PDA ?

javascript load BTF
derive typescript types from BTF
We need some sdk BTF type (Pubk, system program, ...)

Call function by providing BTF offset ?
Vs call by name +  arguments with type check ?
